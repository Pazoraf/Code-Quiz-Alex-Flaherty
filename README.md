# Code-Quiz-Alex-Flaherty


## Description
My intention with this project was to create a timed multiple choice coding quiz, that dynamically updates the HTML and CSS based on user-input. I also wanted to be able to save the user's initials and score and display them onto a highscore page.

The site is deployed [here.](https://pazoraf.github.io/Code-Quiz-Alex-Flaherty/)
